type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

The Dynaview Plugin makes it possible to build user interfaces that dynamically respond to changes in the browser viewport via scrolling or zooming:

* CSS classes that allow rendering to be deferred until the output is scrolled into view
* CSS classes that allow the opacity of DOM elements to vary according to the current zoom level
