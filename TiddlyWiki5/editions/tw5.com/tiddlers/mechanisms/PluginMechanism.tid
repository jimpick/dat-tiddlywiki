! Introduction

[[Plugins]] are bundles of tiddlers that are distributed and managed as a single unit by being packed into a single JSON tiddler. Users can install them with drag and drop, or using the [[plugin library|Installing a plugin from the plugin library]].

The tiddlers within registered plugins behave as ShadowTiddlers: they can be freely overwritten by creating a tiddler with the same title, but deleting that tiddler restores the underlying tiddler value from the plugin.

Plugins have a `plugin-type` field that may take the following values:

* `plugin` //(default)// - a plain plugin
* `theme` - a theme plugin (see ThemeMechanism)
* `language` - for translations only

Plugins can be used to package ordinary content, or can include JavaScript [[modules|Modules]] that extend and enhance the core TiddlyWiki5 functionality.

Plugins conventionally have a title of the form `$:/plugins/publisher/name`. Plugins that are part of the core TiddlyWiki distribution have titles of the form `$:/plugins/tiddlywiki/name`.

When [[running TiddlyWiki under Node.js|TiddlyWiki on Node.js]], plugins can also be stored as individual tiddler files in [[PluginFolders]].
