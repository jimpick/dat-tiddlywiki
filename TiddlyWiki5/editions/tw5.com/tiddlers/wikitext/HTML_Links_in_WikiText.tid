It is often useful to be able to create HTML links to external resources. For example, here the value of the `href` attribute will be set to the value of the tiddler MyLinkDestination:

```
<a href={{MyLinkDestination}}>link</a>
```

However, there is an unexpected security issue that means that most of the time the link should have the `rel` attribute set to `noopener noreferrer` to maintain privacy of the URLs of private TiddlyWiki's (eg on Dropbox). See https://mathiasbynens.github.io/rel-noopener/ for more information.

```
<a href={{MyLinkDestination}} rel="noopener noreferrer">link</a>
```
