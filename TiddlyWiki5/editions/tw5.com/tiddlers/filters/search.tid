title: search Operator
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki
caption: search
op-purpose: filter the input by searching tiddler content
op-input: a [[selection of titles|Title Selection]]
op-suffix: optionally, the name of a [[field|TiddlerFields]]
op-suffix-name: F
op-parameter: one or more search terms, separated by spaces
op-output: those input tiddlers in which <<.em all>> of the search terms can be found in the value of field <<.place F>>
op-neg-output: those input tiddlers in which <<.em not>> all of the search terms can be so found

When used with a suffix, the <<.op search>> operator is similar to <<.olink regexp>> but less powerful.

If the suffix is omitted, a tiddler is deemed to match if all the search terms appear in the combination of its <<.field tags>>, <<.field text>> and <<.field title>> fields.

The search ignores the difference between capital and lowercase letters.
