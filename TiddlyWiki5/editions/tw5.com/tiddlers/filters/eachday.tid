title: eachday Operator
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki
caption: eachday
op-purpose: select one of each group of input titles by date
op-input: a [[selection of titles|Title Selection]]
op-parameter: the name of a [[date field|Date Fields]], defaulting to <<.field modified>>
op-parameter-name: F
op-output: a selection containing the first input title encountered for each distinct value (ignoring times of day) of field <<.place F>>

Each input title is processed in turn. The value of field <<.place F>> in the corresponding tiddler is examined, and as long as this indicates a date that has not been encountered before, the title is appended to the output.

If a tiddler doesn't contain field <<.place F>>, it contributes nothing to the output.
