title: Contributor License Agreement
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Like other OpenSource projects, TiddlyWiki5 needs a signed contributor license agreement from individual contributors. This is a legal agreement that allows contributors to assert that they own the copyright of their contribution, and that they agree to license it to the UnaMesa Association (the legal entity that owns TiddlyWiki on behalf of the community).

* For individuals use: [[licenses/CLA-individual|https://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyWiki5/tree/master/licenses/cla-individual.md]]
* For entities use: [[licenses/CLA-entity|https://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyWiki5/tree/master/licenses/cla-entity.md]]
