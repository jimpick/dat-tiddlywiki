TiddlyServer is a special purpose Desktop app, designed to facilitate managing multiple instances of TiddlyWiki running as a server.  It does not require internet acess to access the wikis.

TiddlyServer can import both TiddlyWiki files and TiddlyFolder wikis.  For each wiki, you specify a prefix to serve it with and the source to import from.  It will copy the wikis to its own internal store and begin serving them up at http://localhost:8080/{prefix}/.  The export button for each wiki will convert it to a single file wiki.
