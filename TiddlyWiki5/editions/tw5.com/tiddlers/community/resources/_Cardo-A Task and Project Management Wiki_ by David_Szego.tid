Cardo is a standalone, browser-based tool that can be used as a simple task manager, or as a complex Project Management system (and indeed, I do use it this way in my daily work) as well as a fully Wiki-ized personal knowledge store. It runs completely independently in the browser, even without an Internet connection, making it possible to carry around on a USB stick, or to use on the morning commute.
