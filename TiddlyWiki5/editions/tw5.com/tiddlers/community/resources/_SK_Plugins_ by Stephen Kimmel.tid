In keeping with the general spirit of the TiddlyWiki community, ie, you develop something useful and/or potentially interesting you share it with others, I'm sharing some of the plugins I've developed to go with the new Editor Toolbar. You'll find them and a more extensive discussion of what each does at http://skplugins.tiddlyspot.com/
