type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki
url: https://github.com/pmario/file-backups

An extension for Mozilla Firefox that smoothes out some of the friction from ~TiddlyWiki's built-in [[HTML5 fallback saver|Saving with the HTML5 fallback saver]], making it almost as easy to use as ~TiddlyFox. The workflow is intended to work out of the box, without configuration.

A chrome version is planned!
