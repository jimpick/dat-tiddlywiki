The following sidebar tabs give examples of grouped lists created by nesting.

!! Types Tab

For the [[Types|$:/core/ui/MoreSideBar/Types]] tab, the outer list filter as shown below selects each discrete value found in the `type` field. The inner list filter selects all the (non-system) tiddlers with that type.

<<tw-code "$:/core/ui/MoreSideBar/Types">>

!! Recent Tab

The list in the [[Recent|$:/core/ui/SideBar/Recent]] tab is generated using the <<.mlink timeline>> macro. Here, the outer list filter selects each discrete day found in the `modified` field, while the inner list filter selects all the tiddlers dated the same day in the `modified` field.
