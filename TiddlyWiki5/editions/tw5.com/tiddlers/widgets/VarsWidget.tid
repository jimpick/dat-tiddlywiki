! Introduction

The ''vars'' widget allows multiple variables to be set in one operation. In some situations it can result in simpler code than using the more flexible SetWidget.

! Content and Attributes

The content of the `<$vars>` widget is the scope for the value assigned to the variable.

|!Attribute |!Description |
|//{attributes not starting with $}// |Each attribute name specifies a variable name. The attribute value is assigned to the variable |

! Examples

Consider a case where you need to set multiple variables.

Using the `<$vars>` widget, this situation may be handled in the following way:

```
\define helloworld() Hello world!

<$vars greeting="Hi" me={{!!title}} sentence=<<helloworld>>>
  <<greeting>>! I am <<me>> and I say: <<sentence>>
</$vars>
```

In contrast, here is the same example using the `<$set>` widget:

```
<$set name="greeting" value="Hi" >
<$set name="me" value={{!!title}} >
<$set name="sentence" value=<<helloworld>> >
  <<greeting>>! I am <<me>> and I say: <<sentence>>
</$set>
</$set>
</$set>
```

! Remarks

It should be noted that this widget differs from the set widget in the following ways:

* A fallback (also known as "emptyValue") cannot be specified
* Filters cannot be used to produce a conditional variable assignement
* Variable names must be literal strings
