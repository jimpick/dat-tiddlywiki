! Introduction

The dropzone widget creates an area into which the user can drag files and other objects. It also supports pasting via the clipboard, although browser support is currently limited.

It sends a [[WidgetMessage: tm-import-tiddlers]] carrying a JSON representation of the tiddlers to be imported up through its parents. This message usually trapped by the NavigatorWidget which adds the tiddlers to the store and updates the story to display them.

! Content and Attributes

|!Attribute |!Description |
|deserializer |<<.from-version "5.1.15">> Optional name of deserializer to be used (by default the deserializer is derived from the file extension) |

The list of available deserializers can be inspected by executing `Object.keys($tw.Wiki.tiddlerDeserializerModules).sort().join("\n")` in the browser JavaScript console.

The dropzone widget displays any contained content within the dropzone.

! Display

The dropzone widget creates an HTML `<div class="tc-dropzone">` to contain its content. During a drag operation the class `tc-dragover` is added. CSS is used to provide user feedback.

! Data types supported

The following data transfer types are supported:

* ''text/vnd.tiddler'' - a list of tiddlers in JSON format (this format is generated by the LinkWidget)
* ''text/plain'' - plain text
* ''text/uri-list'' - a list of URIs as a single tiddler
