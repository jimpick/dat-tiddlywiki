! Introduction

The fields widget renders each field of a specified tiddler through a simple text template. A list of fields to exclude can be provided. It is used internally by TiddlyWiki5, notably by the FileSavingMechanism.

!! Template Handling

The provided template is rendered with the following special substitutions:

|!Symbol |!Substitution |
|$name$ |Field name |
|$value$ |Field value |
|$encoded_value$ |HTML encoded form of field value |

! Content and Attributes

The content of the `<$fields>` widget is ignored.

|!Attribute |!Description |
|tiddler |Title of the tiddler from which the fields are to be displayed (defaults to the [[current tiddler|Current Tiddler]]) |
|template |Text of the template (see above) |
|exclude |Lists of fields to be excluded (defaults to "text") |
|stripTitlePrefix |If set to "yes" then curly bracketed prefixes are removed from titles (for example `{prefix}HelloThere` converts to `HelloThere`) |

The `stripTitlePrefix` attribute is used when building TiddlyWiki Classic; see `editions/tw2` in the TiddlyWiki5 repo.
