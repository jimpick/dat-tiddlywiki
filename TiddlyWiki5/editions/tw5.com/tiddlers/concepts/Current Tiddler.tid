title: Current Tiddler
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

The <<.def "current tiddler">> provides the context in which several aspects of WikiText are interpreted.

For example, `{{!!title}}` denotes the value of the <<.field title>> field of whatever the current tiddler happens to be. This technique can be used to create general-purpose [[template tiddlers|TemplateTiddlers]].

The title of the current tiddler can always be found in the <<.vlink currentTiddler>> variable.

The two most common ways in which the current tiddler is changed are:

* the <<.wlink TiddlerWidget>> widget
* the <<.wlink ListWidget>> widget (when its <<.attr variable>> attribute is not overridden)

The current tiddler is therefore often <<.em not>> the same as the [[tiddler that is being viewed or edited|storyTiddler Variable]].
