title: How to turn off camel case linking
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

CamelCase is used in most Wikis, but it can interfere with text presentation in some situations.

!! Turning off Camel Case locally

To turn off a particular instance of a CamelCase text, simply put a tilde (~)  in front of the word, like this:

```
~CamelCase
```

!! Turning off Camel Case globally

To turn off CamelCase in all tiddlers, navigate to the [[Control Panel|$:/ControlPanel]].  Select the `Settings` tab and then scroll or read down to the ``Camel Case Wiki Links`` section and unselect ``Enable automatic CamelCase linking``.
