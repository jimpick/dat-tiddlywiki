title: Preserving open tiddlers at startup
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Ordinarily, at startup TiddlyWiki displays the tiddlers specified as a filter in the tiddler [[$:/DefaultTiddlers]].

Sometimes it's useful to re-open the same tiddlers that were open when the file was saved. To do so, set [[$:/DefaultTiddlers]] to this filter:

```
[list[$:/StoryList]]
```

This filter returns the tiddlers specified in the [[$:/StoryList]] tiddler, which is the system tiddler that TiddlyWiki uses to store the sequence of tiddlers in the current story.
