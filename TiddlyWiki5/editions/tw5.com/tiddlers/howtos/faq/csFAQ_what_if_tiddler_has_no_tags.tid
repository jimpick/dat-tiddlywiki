title: Q: What if a tiddler has no tags?
tags: [[Custom Styles FAQ]]

''Answer:'' <<.from-version "5.1.16">>

* If a tiddler has no tags, but needs styling use: `data-tiddler-title` as CSS selector
** There is only one tiddler 

* If a user wants to style system tiddlers in a custom way: use: `[data-tiddler-title^="$:"/]` as a selector
** using the TW namespace functionality

* If the user wants special behaviour for tagged tiddlers. eg: Learning
** use: `[data-tags*="Learning"]` as CSS selector. 

The names I'm using are only used for documentation purpose, without changing the existing wiki. I don't want, that the docs has side effects.
