title: How to export tiddlers
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

! Selecting All tiddlers for export

To export ''all'' tiddlers click on the "Tools" tab of the Sidebar. Find and click the {{$:/core/images/export-button}} ''export all'' button. A pop-up menu will offer you the chance to export tiddlers in multiple formats.

! Exporting a tiddler

If you want to export a particular tiddler, first navigate to that tiddler. Then click on the {{$:/core/images/down-arrow}} ''more'' button that appears above the tiddler. From the list that appears select {{$:/core/images/export-button}} ''export tiddler''. A pop-up menu will offer you the chance to export the tiddler in multiple formats.

! Exporting tiddlers matching a criteria (filter)

To export a selection of tiddlers, click the little magnifying glass {{$:/core/images/advanced-search-button}} next to the search area on the sidebar. This will open the [[Advanced Search|$:/AdvancedSearch]] tiddler. Click on the "Filter" tab of the Advanced Search tiddler. Only the [[Filter|Filters]] tab will allow you to export a selection of tiddlers. [[Filters]] follow a particular syntax. Click on this [[Filters|Filters]] link to learn about how to make filters.

Once you have written a filter, a list of tiddlers matching the filter will appear. Now you can click on the {{$:/core/images/export-button}} ''export tiddler'' button to the right of the filter input field. A pop-up menu will offer you the chance to export tiddlers in multiple formats.

! Export formats

Currently, the export formats available are:

* CSV file format
* JSON file format
* Static HTML file
* ".tid" file format

The ``".tid"`` format is unique from the other formats in that only one tiddler will be exported, even if you are attempting to export all tiddlers or a selection of tiddlers.
