title: How to hide the author's and other fields with CSS
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Sometimes you might want to save some screen space by hiding away the author's name in all tiddlers. Here's a quick way to do it:

* Create a new tiddler with any title you want.
* Give the tiddler the tag `$:/tags/Stylesheet`
* In the text field of the tiddler put:

```
.tc-subtitle .tc-tiddlylink {display:none;}
```

* Save the tiddler. The author's name field should no longer appear.

Similarly, the entire subtitle field including author and date can be removed with:

```
.tc-subtitle {display:none;}
```

Unfortunately, you can't hide just the date without also hiding the author using CSS.

And finally, for a truly minimalist look, you can remove the title with:

```
h2.tc-title {display:none;)
```
