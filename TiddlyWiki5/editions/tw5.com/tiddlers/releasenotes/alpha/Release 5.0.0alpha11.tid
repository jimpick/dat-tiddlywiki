This release is the culmination of a large scale refactoring of the widget mechanism of TiddlyWiki5. There are several changes to be aware of if upgrading from earlier versions:

* The following widgets have been removed:
** `<$setstyle>` - use `<div style=<<macroName Param>>>` instead
** `<$video>` - will return in a later release
** `<$datauri>` - use the `<<makedatauri>>` built-in macro instead
** `<$error>` - may return in a later release
** `<$import>` - use the BrowseWidget, DropzoneWidget and NavigatorWidget instead
** `<$info>` - use the `<<changecount>>` built-in macro instead
** `<$version>` - use the `<<version>>` built-in macro instead
* The following widgets have had significant changes:
** EditWidget
** ListWidget - the list widget itself no longer generates HTML nodes, so you'll often need to wrap the template in a `<div>` or a `<span>` to be able to style the content
** ViewWidget - has several changes:
*** `<$view format="link"/>` is no longer available; use an explicit `<$link>` widget instead
*** `<$view format="link"/>` is no longer available; use the TranscludeWidget instead
* The following new widgets have been added:
** BrowseWidget
** DropzoneWidget
** EditTextWidget and EditBitmapWidget
** SetVariableWidget
* Widget attribute names have been made more consistent. In particular, `tiddler` is used to reference a tiddler by title, not `title`
* It is no longer possible to import the macro definitions within another tiddler by transcluding that tiddler
* The `body` element now has the class `tw-body`, which will need to be specified in any overrides
** This was done due to the new support for HTML foreign objects, which makes it possible to have multiple `<body>` elements in a document
