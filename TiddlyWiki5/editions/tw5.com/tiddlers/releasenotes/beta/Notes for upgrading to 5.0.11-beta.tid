title: Notes for upgrading to 5.0.11-beta
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Version 5.0.11-beta includes some changes that can break content from earlier releases of ~TiddlyWiki 5.

! Command line changes

Previously, commands that generate output files would interpret the specified path to the file as being relative to the current working directory. So, for example, the following command would write `index.html` to the current directory:

```
tiddlywiki mywiki --rendertiddler $:/core/save/all index.html text/plain
```

In 5.0.11-beta this behaviour has changed, and now the specified filename is resolved relative to an `output` folder within the TiddlyWikiFolder. So the command above will now write the file `index.html` to `mywiki/output/index.html`.

You can override this behaviour with the OutputCommand. For example, to generate the `index.html` file within the current directory:

```
tiddlywiki mywiki --output . --rendertiddler $:/core/save/all index.html text/plain
```

A further change is that the `--rendertiddlers` command now clears the output folder before it writes any files. This means that any previous `--rendertiddler` commands to the same folder will have their output deleted.
