title: Comma-Separated Values
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

<<.dlink-ex CSV "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">> is a standard plain-text format for storing a table of data.

Each row of the table is called a <<.def record>> and occupies one line.

The columns are called <<.def fields>>. Each field of a row is separated from the next by a comma, and is often delimited by quotation marks.

The <<.mlink csvtiddlers>> macro returns tiddler content in this format.
