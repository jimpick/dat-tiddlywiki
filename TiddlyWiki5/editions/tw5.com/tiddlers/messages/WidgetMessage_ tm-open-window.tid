The `tm-open-window` message opens a tiddler in a new //browser// window. If no parameters are specified, the current tiddler is opened in a new window. Similiar to `tm-modal` any additional parameters passed via the <<.param "paramObject">> are being provided as variables to the new window.

|!Name |!Description |
|param |Title of the tiddler to be opened in a new browser window, defaults to <<.var "currentTiddler">> if empty |
|template |Template in which the tiddler will be rendered in |
|width |Width of the new browser window |
|height |Height of the new browser window |
|print |Set to "yes" to trigger opening of the browser print dialogue  |
|paramObject |Hashmap of variables that will be provided to the window  |


The `tm-open-window` message is usually generated with the ButtonWidget and is handled by the core itself.
