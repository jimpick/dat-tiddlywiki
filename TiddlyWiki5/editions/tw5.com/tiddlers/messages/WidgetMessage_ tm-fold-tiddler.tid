title: WidgetMessage: tm-fold-tiddler
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

The `tm-fold-tiddler` message folds the tiddler specified in the `param` parameter. It does so by setting the text of a state tiddler to either "<<.value "show">>" or "<<.value "hide">>", according to the fold state.

|!Name |!Description |
|param|Title of the tiddler that should be folded. If the tiddler is already folded, it will be unfolded instead. |
|foldedStatePrefix |Prefix for the state tiddler in which the fold state is stored. If no state prefix is provided, `tm-fold-tiddler` will do nothing. |

<<.tip "The core uses a foldStatePrefix of '$:/state/folded/' to store the fold states for the default story view.">>

The `tm-fold-tiddler` message is usually generated with the ButtonWidget and is handled by the surrounding NavigatorWidget.
