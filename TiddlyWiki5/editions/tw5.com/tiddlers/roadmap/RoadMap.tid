There are still some areas of TiddlyWiki that have not been fully developed beyond the experimental stage:

* Multiple users with the client-server configuration
* Smartphone user experience
* New tiddler manager, including bulk operations like search and replace
* Federation that can run in the browser or under Node.js
* Improved editions
* Improved support for third party plugin libraries
