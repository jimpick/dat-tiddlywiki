title: Using links to navigate between tiddlers
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

You can use links (normally displayed as blue text) to navigate from one tiddler to another. Clicking on a link to any tiddler will take you to that tiddler. If the tiddler is closed, it will be opened. The wonderful thing about ~TiddlyWiki is that it makes links to tiddlers as accessible as possible. There are links everywhere! Here are the key places where you can find links to tiddlers in ~TiddlyWiki:

* You can ''create a link'' to a tiddler, whether it exists yet or not, in the body of any tiddler. See [[Linking in WikiText]] to see the various easy ways to create links between tiddlers.

* Each ''tag pill'' in your tiddler (such as the ''Working with ~TiddlyWiki'' tag pill below the title of this tiddler) contains a link to that tag's tiddler, as well as lists of all the tiddlers that carry that tag. This lets you go to any of those tiddlers.

* The ''InfoPanel'' of each tiddler gives you access to four tabs containing additional lists of related tiddlers:

** The ''References'' tab lists all the tiddlers that link //to// the current tiddler.

** The ''Tagging'' tab lists all the tiddlers that have been tagged with the current tiddler's title.

** The ''List'' tab lists all the tiddlers (or potential tiddlers) mentioned in the [[list field|ListField]] of the current tiddler.

** The ''Listed'' tab lists all the tiddlers that mention the current tiddler in //their// list fields.

* The ''sidebar tabs'' contain numerous lists of links to tiddlers:

** The ''Open'' tab lists all the tiddlers that are currently open, i.e. visible somewhere on the page.

** The ''Recent'' tab lists the 100 most recently modified tiddlers, beginning with the most recently modified.

** The ''More'' tab offers eight additional lists of tiddlers:

*** ''All'' lists all tiddlers in alphabetical order.

*** ''Tags'' lists all the tags. You can click on the pill for any tag to access a list of the tiddlers tagged with that tag.

*** ''Missing'' lists any tiddlers that don't yet exist, but have been linked to from other tiddlers. This is helpful for finding tiddlers you planned to create, but never got around to.

*** ''Drafts'' lists any tiddlers that are currently in draft mode. ~TiddlyWiki considers a tiddler's draft to be a separate tiddler for as long as you are editing it, so while you're editing a tiddler entitled ''Australia'', there will be two tiddlers, ''Australia'' and ''Draft of 'Australia&apos;''. When you close the draft by saving your changes to it, those changes will be applied to the ''Australia'' tiddler. So treat the ''Drafts'' tab as a way of finding any unfinished drafts you started.

*** ''Orphans'' lists all the tiddlers that are not directly linked from another tiddler. This is a helpful aid to editing your file - it shows you which tiddlers need to be integrated more carefully with the others.

*** ''Types'' lists any tiddlers with special content, such as images or audio.

*** ''System'' lists all of the SystemTiddlers.

*** ''Shadows'' lists all of the ShadowTiddlers.

* ''Search results'' are a list of the tiddlers that contain the text you type in the search box.

* Finally, you can create your own custom lists of tiddlers by various methods:

** You can transclude a [[filter|Filters]] (see [[Transclusion in WikiText]]). For example, adding `{{{ [tag[mountain]] }}}` to a tiddler will insert a list of all tiddlers tagged with ''mountain''.

** You can use the ListWidget. This is more complicated than transcluding a [[filter|Filters]], but in return it allows you more flexibility in designing and displaying the list exactly as you want it to appear.
