|`0WW` |Adds a leading zero |
|`MMM` |Month in full (eg, "July") |
|`mmm` |Short month (eg, "Jul") |
|`MM` |Month number |
|`0MM` |Adds leading zero |
|`YYYY` |Full year |
|`YY` |Two digit year |
|`wYYYY` |Full year with respect to week number |
|`wYY` |Two digit year with respect to week number |
|`hh` |Hours |
|`0hh` |Adds a leading zero |
|`hh12` |Hours in 12 hour clock |
|`0hh12` |Hours in 12 hour clock with leading zero |
|`mm` |Minutes |
|`0mm` |Minutes with leading zero |
|`ss` |Seconds |
|`0ss` |Seconds with leading zero |
|`XXX` |Milliseconds |
|`0XXX` |Milliseconds with leading zero |
|`am` or `pm` |Lower case AM/PM indicator |
|`AM` or `PM` |Upper case AM/PM indicator |
|`TZD` |Timezone offset |
|`\x` |Used to escape a character that would otherwise have special meaning |
|`[UTC]`|Time-shift the represented date to UTC. Must be at very start of format string|

Note that other text is passed through unchanged, allowing commas, colons or other separators to be used.
