Searching is fast and flexible in ~TiddlyWiki.

! Standard search

Typing text into the search box in the sidebar will turn up a list of all the tiddlers that contain that text.

://(Note that the sidebar tabs will be hidden by the search results until you click the 'x' to the right of the search box to remove the search results)//

! Advanced searching

Clicking on the magnifying glass icon {{$:/core/images/advanced-search-button}} to the right of the search box will open [[$:/AdvancedSearch]]. This tiddler contains four tabs:

* The ''standard'' tab contains another instance of the search box found in the sidebar
* The ''system'' tab allows you to limit your search to system tiddlers
* The ''shadows'' tab allows you to limit your search to shadow tiddlers
* The ''filter'' tab is not a search box, per se, but a way to obtain a list of all tiddlers that meet the specific criteria described by that [[filter|Filters]], for example, "All tags except system tags"
