The AndTidWiki app for Android devices makes it possible to edit and save changes to TiddlyWiki5, including working offline without a network connection. [[Download it here|https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.mgsimon.android.andtidwiki&hl=en]].

Instructions for use:

# [[Download]] an empty TiddlyWiki on another web browser
# Move the file you just downloaded to the directory `/sdcard/andtidwiki`
#* You may rename it, but be sure to keep the `.html` or `.htm` extension
# Open AndTidWiki
#* Don't use ''Menu''/''new ~TiddlyWiki'' menu option (it only supports the older TiddlyWikiClassic)
# Open the file by touching its filename
# Try creating a new tiddler using the ''new tiddler'' {{$:/core/images/new-button}} button in the sidebar. Type some content for the tiddler, and click the {{$:/core/images/done-button}} ''ok'' button
#* The wiki will be saved, and a confirmation message should appear at the top right of the window

''Note:'' You can save your changes by clicking the {{$:/core/images/save-button}} ''save changes'' button in the sidebar even if you have not clicked the {{$:/core/images/done-button}} ''ok'' button to complete editing a tiddler
