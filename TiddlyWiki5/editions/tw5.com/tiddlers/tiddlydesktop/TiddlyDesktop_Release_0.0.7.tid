 * Experimental support for "wiki folders" (the Node.js format for TiddlyWiki, where each tiddler is a separate file), including the ability to serve wiki folders over HTTP so that you can use any browser or device to access them
 * Switched from representing wikis as thumbnails to favicons
 * New system tray/menu icon for quick access to TiddlyDesktop
 * Fixed problem with restarting after quitting with minimised windows on Windows (#77)
 * Added TiddlyDesktop version number to "Help" window

Note: Upgrading to this release will clear your list of loaded wiki files. The files themselves are not affected; you can re-add them by dragging and dropping them into the wiki list window.
