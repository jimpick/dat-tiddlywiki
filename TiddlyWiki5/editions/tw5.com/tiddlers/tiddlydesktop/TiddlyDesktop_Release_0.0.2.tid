This second version of TiddlyDesktop has the following fixes and improvements:

*The saving mechanism is now TiddlyFox compatible, so TiddlyWiki5 wikis don't need a special plugin to work with TiddlyDesktop
*TiddlyDesktop is now compatible with TiddlyWiki Classic
*Chromium Developer Tools now accessible via a pulldown menu
*Each TiddlyWiki document is now sandboxed, so it isn't possible for malicious or buggy JavaScript to affect other documents
*Linux 32-bit and 64-bit builds
