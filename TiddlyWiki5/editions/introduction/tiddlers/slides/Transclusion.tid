tags: [[This is a tag]] [[This is another tag]]

Transcluding a tiddler inserts a copy of its content, allowing you to reuse the same text or image more than once. For example,

```
This is my cat {{Motovun Jack.svg}} and his identical twin {{Motovun Jack.svg}}
```

<div class="tc-example-box">
This is my cat {{Motovun Jack.svg}} and his identical twin {{Motovun Jack.svg}}
</div>
