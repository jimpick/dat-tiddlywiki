!!"""Cell Formatting"""
*Insert a space before cell content to right justify cell
*Insert a space after cell content to left justify cell
*Insert spaces before and after cell content to centre justify cell
*Insert an exclamation mark ({{{!}}}) as the first non-space character of a cell to turn it into a header cell

!!"""Table Headers and Footers"""
* Mark a table row as a header by adding an 'h' to the end
* Mark a table row as a footer by adding an 'f' to the end
{{{
|NW|N|NE|h
|W|X|E|
|SW|S|SE|f
}}}
|NW|N|NE|h

Use  an exclamation mark to turn an individual cell into a header cell of type {{{<th}}}...
{{{
| NW| !N |NE |h
| !W| X |!E |
| SW| !S |SE |f
}}}
| NW| !N |NE |h
| !W| X |!E |
| SW| !S |SE |f
!!"""Table Caption"""
A caption can be added to a table by adding a {{{c}}} after the last column either before the main table...
{{{
|A caption above the table|c
|North West|North|North East|
|West|Here|East|
|South West|South|South East|

!!"""Merging Table Cells"""
Merge a cell horizontally with the one to its right using greater-than {{{>}}}...
{{{
|North West|North|North East|
|>|>|West and Here and East|
|South West|South|South East|
}}}
|North West|North|North East|
|>|>|West and Here and East|
|South West|South|South East|
Merge a cell vertically with the one above using a tilde {{{~}}}...
{{{
|Westerly|North|North East|
|~|Here|East|
|~|South|South East|
}}}
|Westerly|North|North East|
|~|Here|East|
|~|South|South East|
!!"""CSS Formatting for Tables"""
A CSS class can be added to an entire table using a special first row that ends with a {{{k}}}...
{{{
|myClass|k
|North West|North|North East|
|West|Here|East|
|South West|South|South East|
}}}
Use your StyleSheet tiddler to define the desired styles.

CSS properties can also be added to individual table cells by appending the CSS syntax directly after the delimiting pipe {{{|}}}.
{{{
|color:red; North West|opacity:0.5;North|North East|
|color(green):West|Here|East|
|South West|South|South East|
}}}
|color:red; North West|opacity:0.5;North|North East|
|color(green):West|Here|East|
|South West|South|South East|
!!"""Alternating Row Colors"""
TiddlyWiki automatically assigns the classes {{{oddRow}}} and {{{evenRow}}} to table row elements {{{<TR>}}}. These can then be styled using the StyleSheet tiddler:
{{{
tr.oddRow { background-color: #fff; }
tr.evenRow { background-color: #ffe; }
}}}
