! Features

* Loads skinny tiddlers from entire recipe at startup/login
* Subsequently syncs changes back to the server
* Polls for changes from the server

! Issues

* ''[[$:/DefaultTiddlers]]'' doesn't work because thanks to lazy loading it is only loaded after it is needed
* Ignores ''if-match'' header, so doesn't detect clashes on save
* UI state (eg current tab status) is shared between all users of the wiki, meaning that the UI can spontaneously change in response to a server sync
