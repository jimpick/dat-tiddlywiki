Browsers still have significant variations in their handling of drag and drop and clipboard operations.

You can switch on special logging to help debug issues:

# Open your browser JavaScript console
# Type:
#> ``$tw.log.IMPORT = true``
# Drag or paste a file to import it
# Look for debug information in the console. For example:
#> ``Importing file 'my-image.png', type: 'image/png', isBinary: true``
