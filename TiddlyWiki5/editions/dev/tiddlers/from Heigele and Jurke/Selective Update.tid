title: Selective Update

With [[Messages]] a widget is able to put some kind of events into the TiddlyWiki application which is one part of the dynamic behaviour of widgets.
The other part is selective updating.
Widgets are often dependant on tiddler states.
The [[ListWidget|https://tiddlywiki.com/#ListWidget]] for example can be configured to list all tiddlers which are tagged with "important".
Now, when such a tiddler is changed and it's "important" tag is removed, this change should reflect in the ~ListWidget.
To allow widgets to react on such changes, each widget can provide a function ``refresh(changedTiddlers)``.
The [[RootWidget|RootWidget and Rendering Startup]] is registered to the wiki store, using the [[Event Mechanism]]. When an change event occurs it starts to call the refresh function of its children with a list of the changed tiddlers.
Each widget can then decide if it has to change or re-render its DOM representation and call the refresh function of its own children.
This way every time a tiddler or the wiki store itself changes, each widget can instantly react on these changes or ignore them.

Another way of updating are text reference attributes (text references explained in [[Transclusion and TextReference]]):

```js
{type: "indirect", textReference: <textReference>}
```

When a widget got a attribute which is a text reference and the refresh function is called, it can check if the text reference references a changed tiddler and update accordingly.

Nearly every state of the UI is stored in tiddlers. A search mechanism for example would use a ~EditTextWidget which shows an text input field for the search string and a ListWidget to show the results.
The ~EditTextWidget is bound to a tiddler [[$:/temp/search]]. Meaning when editing the text in the input field the tiddlers content is changed to this text. On the other hand when the tiddler changes the [[RootWidget|RootWidget and Rendering Startup]] is notified. It then starts calling its childrens refresh methods. Eventually the refresh method of the ~EditTextWidget is called and it can re-render itself if necessary.
This way TiddlyWiki can re-use an already existing data structure which is not only convenient because we don't need to introduce an additional structure but tiddlers managed in the wiki store are already a pretty powerful data structure, supporting an [[Event Mechanism]] (so we don't need an additional observer pattern), [[Caching]], Metadata by additional tiddler fields and a [[way to obtain specific tiddlers|Tags and Filter Mechanism]].
