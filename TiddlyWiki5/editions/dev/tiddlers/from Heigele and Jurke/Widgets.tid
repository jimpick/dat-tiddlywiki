title: Widgets

When the WikiText has been transformed into a parse-tree the next step is to transform this parse-tree into a widget-tree.
We talked about widgets as parts of the WikiText markup but in fact each node of the parse-tree is transformed to a widget object.
The core plug-in provides a basic widget object which gets the parse node it should represent and a DOM node. The widget then must create the DOM structure which represents the parse node and add it to the provided DOM node.
A ~LinkWidget for example would create the DOM node for a ``<a>...</a>`` tag and put it in the provided DOM node.
When a widget gets a parse node with child nodes it must create the corresponding child widgets.

All this functionality is basically provided with the base widget. But when creating the widget for a parse node it loads additional modules with ``module-type: widget``. These modules can export multiple widgets which extend the base widget and can override it's methods like the rendering and refresh functions.
As described in [[Parser]] each parse node contains a "type" property. This type directly determines which widget module is used.

```js
{type: "text", text: <string>} - a text node
```

Would be transformed to a [[TextWidget|$:/core/modules/widgets/text.js]].
(Note that the ~TextWidget module exports a property "text".)

So in fact when talking about widgets in WikiText, they are not a feature added to WikiText but the ability to directly use a specific widget instead of the parser choosing a widget type.

In the beginning we talked about widgets and how they enable dynamic behaviour. But up until now we only described how widgets create DOM nodes from parse nodes.
Widgets add dynamic behaviour in two ways.
