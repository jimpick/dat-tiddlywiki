title: Using Modules to build a Single File Application

TW is built up from the micro kernel and uses the module mechanism to provide various ways of loading and saving tiddlers, including the ability to load and save to a single HTML file.
Furthermore a developer can extend the application by providing modules with a specific module-type. TW searches for modules with these specific module-types and handles them accordingly.

The last sequence of the boot kernel is to execute startup modules. One of these startup modules ("load-modules") is responsible for registering some modules with specific module types at the right place. For example, the methods exported by wikimethod modules are put in \textit{\$tw.Wiki.prototype}. Other startup modules build up the initial UI and link events to certain modules.
