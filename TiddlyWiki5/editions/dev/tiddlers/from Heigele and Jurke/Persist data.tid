title: Persist data

TiddlyWiki supports a wide range of methods to persist your data. One of this methods is the HTML5 fallback saver. This methods works on almost every browser. With this method a copy of the entire wiki will be downloaded by the browser. This means you get a new file everytime you hit the save button.  To avoid this and because every Browser has a different API to allow writing direct to the file system there a some plugins for the different browsers. These plug-ins allow the user to save direct to the current open TiddlyWiki-File. The Listing below shows the HTML5-compliant to save the changes via the HTML5 fallback saver by downloading the TW as a complete HTML-file.

```js
DownloadSaver.prototype.save = function(text,method,callback) {
	...
	var link = document.createElement("a");
	link.setAttribute("target","_blank");
	...
	link.setAttribute("href","data:text/html," + encodeURIComponent(text));
	...
	link.setAttribute("download",filename);
	document.body.appendChild(link);
	link.click();
	document.body.removeChild(link);
	return true;
};
```
