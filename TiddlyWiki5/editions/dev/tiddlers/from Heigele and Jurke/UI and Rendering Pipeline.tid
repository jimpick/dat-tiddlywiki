title: UI and Rendering Pipeline

The microkernel provides basic functionality to store tiddlers and manage modules and plugins.
The [[Startup Process]] then loads the core plug-in including extensions to the store providing
a [[Event Mechanism]], [[Caching]], [[Tags|Tags and Filter Mechanism]] and a [[Filter Mechanism|Tags and Filter Mechanism]] giving the ability to query for specific tiddlers.

Using some of this techniques the core plug-in also adds some functionalities to load and save single tiddlers or the whole wiki, described in [[Extended Persistence]].

This next chapter will focus on the parts of the core plug-in that provide the UI of TiddlyWiki.
