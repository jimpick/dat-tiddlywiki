title: The User Interface

Following the "anything is a tiddler" concept, even the UI consists of tiddlers.
This is possible because tiddlers can not only contain plain text or JavaScript (modules) but they also can contain a special markup text called WikiText.
By using WikiText the user can put markup elements like tables or images in a tiddler.
To provide some more sophisticated UI elements, WikiText can also contain special widgets like text input fields,
checkboxes, dynamic lists etc.
In most cases, these widgets are used to directly modify or represent the information contained in other tiddlers.
If a tiddler is changed and this change should reflect in an UI element e.g. a widget, a process called selective update takes place. Selective updating means when a tiddler or a set of tiddlers changes, each widget is asked, if changes to this tiddlers would affect its appearance. If so, the respective widget is re-rendered otherwise it remains unchanged.
