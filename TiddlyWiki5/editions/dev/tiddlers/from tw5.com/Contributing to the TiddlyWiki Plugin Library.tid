title: Contributing to the TiddlyWiki Plugin Library
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

The TiddlyWiki Plugin library is the set of plugins, themes and languages that are distributed via https://tiddlywiki.com.

The plugin library is intended to help end users of TiddlyWiki in the following ways:

* By being a reliable, official source of community assets
* Permitting automatic upgrading of plugins during the upgrade process
* Providing a guarantee of backwards compatibility

Plugins in the library need a maintainer who is prepared to make a commitment to keep them tested and fully operational with successive releases of the core code. Many plugins are maintained by the core team.
