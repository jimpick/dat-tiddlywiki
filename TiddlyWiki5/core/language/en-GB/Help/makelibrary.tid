description: Construct library plugin required by upgrade process

Constructs the `$:/UpgradeLibrary` tiddler for the upgrade process.

The upgrade library is formatted as an ordinary plugin tiddler with the plugin type `library`. It contains a copy of each of the plugins, themes and language packs available within the TiddlyWiki5 repository.

This command is intended for internal use; it is only relevant to users constructing a custom upgrade procedure.

```
--makelibrary <title>
```

The title argument defaults to `$:/UpgradeLibrary`.
