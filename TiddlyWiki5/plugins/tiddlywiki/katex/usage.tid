The usual way to include ~LaTeX is to use `$$`. For example:

```
$$\displaystyle f(x) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty\hat f(\xi)\,e^{2 \pi i \xi x}\,d\xi$$
```

Single line equations will render in inline mode. If there are newlines between the `$$` delimiters, the equations will be rendered in display mode.

The underlying widget can also be used directly, giving more flexibility:

```
<$latex text="f(x) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty\hat f(\xi)\,e^{2 \pi i \xi x}\,d\xi" displayMode="true"></$latex>
```

The KaTeX widget is provided under the name `<$latex>` and is also available under the alias `<$katex>`. It's better to use the generic `<$latex>` name unless you are running multiple ~LaTeX plugins and wish to specifically target KaTeX.
