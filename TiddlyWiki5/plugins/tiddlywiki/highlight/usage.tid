! Usage

Fenced code blocks can have a language specifier added to trigger highlighting in a specific language. Otherwise heuristics are used to detect the language.

```
 ```js
 var a = b + c; // Highlighted as JavaScript
 ```
```
! Adding Themes

You can add themes from highlight.js by copying the CSS to a new tiddler and tagging it with [[$:/tags/Stylesheet]]. The available themes can be found on GitHub:
