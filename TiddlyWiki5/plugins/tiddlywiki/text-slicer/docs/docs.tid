! Introduction

This plugin contains tools to help work with documents that are structured as a hierarchical outline of tiddlers.  The structural relationships within the document are expressed through the `list` and `tags` fields: for example, headings have a list specifying the chunks of content to be shown under the heading.

The major components within the text slicer plugin include:

* ''the slicer'', a tool that slices up an existing monolithic document according to the headings, lists and paragraphs. It is available as a toolbar button for the browser, or as a command for use under Node.js
* ''document preview column'', a new sidebar on the left that shows the full text of any documents in the wiki and allows individual tiddlers to be opened with a click
* ''templates'' for previewing and exporting the individual documents as HTML files

Minor components include:

* a new `list-children` filter that returns all the descendents listed in the `list` field of the selected tiddlers
* a new canned filter for [[advanced search|$:/AdvancedSearch]] that lists orphans tiddlers that are not part of any document
