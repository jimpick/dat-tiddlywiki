  abstract   = {With the Web, hypertext has become the paradigmatic rhetorical structure of a global and distributed archive. This paper argues that the scholarly archive is going though a process of hypertextualization that is not adequately accounted for in theories on hypertext. A methodological approach based on Gerard Genettes theory of transtextuality is proposed for a study of the hypertextualized archive. This involves a rejection of the reductionist opposition of hypertext and the fixed linear text, in favor of a study of the intertexts, paratexts and metatexts that work at the interface between texts and archive. I refer to this as second-order textuality.},

  abstract   = {The project of remediating Giacomo Leopardi's Zibaldone addresses the manuscript's hypertextual dimension of cross-references between related passages and their allocation to thematic indexes, which Leopardi wrote with the intention to mediate his research notes into scholarly publications. The project objective is to actualize the author's design for harvesting the Zibaldone's intra-textual semantic networks and reconstruct its inter-textual bibliographic networks by building a digital research platform, which would enable users to comprehensively mine the text's structural complexity. The {XML} encoding in {TEI} P5 allows to process the Zibaldone in custom-selected layers of its encoded elements for the exploration of their interrelations through statistical charts, histograms, network visualizations. In its future development, the platform would expand to an interactive space, where users could add their own annotations to the text and contribute to the site's editorial apparatus. The project has been a collaboration between Princeton University and the Trier Center for Digital Humanities, and its website is currently hosted at http://zibaldone.princeton.edu.},
