title: $:/plugins/tiddlywiki/railroad/readme

This plugin provides a `<$railroad>` widget for generating railroad diagrams as SVG images.

Alternatively, the [[diagram notation|$:/plugins/tiddlywiki/railroad/syntax]] can be stored in a dedicated tiddler with its `type` field set to `text/vnd.tiddlywiki.railroad`, and that tiddler can simply be transcluded to wherever it is needed.

The plugin is based on [[a library by Tab Atkins|https://github.com/tabatkins/railroad-diagrams]], and has been extended to make it more flexible, including allowing components of a diagram to function as links or be transcluded from other tiddlers.
